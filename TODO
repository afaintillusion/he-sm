Thesis Checklist:
  High Priority:
    ☐ latency evaluation
    ☐ baseline metrics:
      ☐ figure out haptic fastest response limit (touch sensitivity number)
      ☐ figure out auditory fastest response limit
      ☐ as extra, mention visual as well
    ☐ start developing presentation slides
      ☐ target time = 30 minutes
    ☐ look into more effective haptics?
    ☐ test more people out!
  Data:
    ☐ Plot of haptic vs. audible performance 
      ☐ across group categories
      ☐ across instrument categories
    ☐ Judy data
      ☐ convert Judy to User ID
      ☐ merge into Combo
    ☐ read up on stats
  Writing:
    ☐ migrate thesis sections to appendix
    ☐ start data analysis section
    ☐ revise abstract
    ☐ write conclusion
    ☐ trim the fat!
