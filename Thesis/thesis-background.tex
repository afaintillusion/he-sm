In a traditional sense, the audible click of Maelzel's metronome minimizes the space with an instantaneous impulse signal though the pendulum motion exhibited seeks to convey meaningful rhythmic information, much like the gestural motion of a conductor.

The conductor "fills 100\% of the space between the crusis (the “click” moments of a beat) with a natural analogue wave that provides the build-up and decay common to natural happenings."[Haptic Enviro-Sensing Metronome, 5]
