\noindent
First and foremost to my advisor and the original inceptor of this work, Professor Stephen Neely. Our weekly discussions kept me on the right path. Thank you for the guidance and experience you brought to this project. I hope this proves to be exemplary to your design research as well as the framework for future work to come.

Tom,

Riccardo, support

To my roommates and close friends, Mike and Craig. For those long nights of brainstorming possibilities and troubleshooting. Thank you for not only being my think tank but for keeping me inspired and grounded.

Last but not least, a special thank you for the undying love and support of Rachel, for keeping the light at the end of the tunnel shining and maintaining my focus toward the end goal.
